We've got some cracking games on today coming from the north all the way to the south.
Right Jeff heres what you've got to do;
Write a function that works out the scoree from the strings provided
Rules: 
Capital letters are a goal
Lower case letters are offside 
For example "MmmMEee" would equal two goals for "M" and one for "E" resulting in "M" taking the win.
Return example: "M" or "Draw"
